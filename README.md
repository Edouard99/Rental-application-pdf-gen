# PDF Watermarking and Document Combination Tool

This tool automatically watermarks PDF files from multiple folders (representing different people) and combines them into a single master document with a title page, table of contents, bookmarks, and separator pages for easy navigation.

## Features

- üîí **Watermarking**: Adds customizable watermarks to all PDF files
- üìë **Smart Combination**: Combines all PDFs into a single document
- üìã **Table of Contents**: Auto-generated with clickable links
- üîñ **Bookmarks (Signets)**: PDF bookmarks for easy navigation
- üè∑Ô∏è **Separator Pages**: Clean separation between different people's documents
- ‚öôÔ∏è **Configuration**: Optional JSON configuration for custom ordering and aliases
- üîÑ **Automatic Scaling**: Watermark text auto-scales to fit page width

## Installation

### Windows (PowerShell)
```powershell
.\setup_environment.ps1
```

### Windows (Command Prompt)
```cmd
setup_environment.bat
```

### Linux/macOS (Bash)
```bash
./setup_environment.sh
```

These scripts will:
1. Create a Python virtual environment
2. Install required dependencies (reportlab, PyPDF2, PyCryptodome)
3. Set up the environment for immediate use

## Input Folder Structure

Create your input folder with the following structure:

```
YourInputFolder/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Person1/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Document1.pdf
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Document2.pdf
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ...
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Person2/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Document1.pdf
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Document2.pdf
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ...
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Person3/
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ...
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ generation.json (optional)
```

### Important Notes:
- Each subfolder represents one person
- PDF files should follow the naming convention: `DocumentType-OtherInfo.pdf`
- The part before the first `-` will be used as the document name in the table of contents
- Underscores (`_`) in document names will be replaced with spaces

### Document Naming Examples:
- `CNI-John.pdf` ‚Üí "CNI"
- `RIB-BankAccount.pdf` ‚Üí "RIB"
- `Contract_Work-2024.pdf` ‚Üí "Contract Work"

## Optional Configuration (generation.json)

Create a `generation.json` file in your input folder to customize:

```json
{
    "Person1": {
        "alias": "John DOE",
        "order": 1
    },
    "Person2": {
        "alias": "Jane SMITH", 
        "order": 2
    },
    "Person3": {
        "alias": "Bob JOHNSON",
        "order": 3
    }
}
```

### Configuration Options:
- **`alias`**: Display name for the person (shown in table of contents and bookmarks)
- **`order`**: Processing order (lower numbers = processed first)

Without configuration, folders are processed in alphabetical order using folder names.

## Usage

### Basic Usage
```bash
python generate_loc_file.py -s ./InputFolder
```

### With Custom Watermark
```bash
python generate_loc_file.py -s ./InputFolder -w "CONFIDENTIAL - RENTAL APPLICATION"
```

### With Custom Title
```bash
python generate_loc_file.py -s ./InputFolder -t "Smith Family Rental Documents"
```

### Complete Example
```bash
python generate_loc_file.py -s ./RentalDocs -w "RESERVED FOR APARTMENT RENTAL" -t "Complete Rental Application - Smith Family"
```

### Command Line Options

| Option | Short | Description | Default |
|--------|-------|-------------|---------|
| `--source` | `-s` | Input folder path | **Required** |
| `--watermark` | `-w` | Watermark text | "RESERVED FOR APARTMENT RENTAL" |
| `--title` | `-t` | Document title | "Rental Application" |

## Output

The tool generates a single PDF file named after your title (e.g., `Smith_Family_Rental_Documents.pdf`) containing:

1. **Title Page** - Shows document title and generation date
2. **Table of Contents** - Clickable links to all sections
3. **Separator Pages** - One per person with "PersonName - Documents"
4. **Documents** - All watermarked PDFs organized by person (alphabetically within each person)

### Navigation Features:
- **Clickable TOC**: Click any entry to jump to that page
- **PDF Bookmarks**: Use your PDF viewer's bookmark panel
- **Separator Pages**: Visual breaks between different people's documents

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

1. **"No PDF files found"**
   - Check that PDF files are in subfolders, not the root input folder
   - Ensure files have `.pdf` extension

2. **"PyCryptodome required"**
   - Some encrypted PDFs need additional decryption
   - Try with unencrypted versions of the PDFs

3. **Watermark text too large**
   - The tool automatically scales down font size
   - Very long text may be truncated with "..."

4. **Wrong processing order**
   - Check your `generation.json` file syntax
   - Ensure folder names match exactly (case-sensitive)

### Excluded Folders:
The following folders are automatically excluded from processing:
- `Dossier Location`
- `protected_files`
- `temp_watermarked`

## Requirements

- Python 3.7+
- reportlab
- PyPDF2
- PyCryptodome
